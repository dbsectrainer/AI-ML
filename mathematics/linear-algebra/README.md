# Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

Linear algebra is fundamental to machine learning and deep learning. This section covers essential concepts needed for understanding and implementing ML algorithms.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Vectors
- Vector operations
- Dot products
- Vector spaces
- Norms and metrics
- Unit vectors

### 2. Matrices
- Matrix operations
- Matrix multiplication
- Transpose
- Inverse matrices
- Special matrices (identity, diagonal, symmetric)

### 3. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Definition and properties
- Eigendecomposition
- Applications in PCA
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

### 4. Linear Transformations
- Geometric interpretations
- Basis and change of basis
- Linear independence
- Rank and nullity

## Practical Applications

### In Machine Learning
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear regression
- Covariance matrices
- Neural network weight matrices
- Dimensionality reduction

## Code Examples

```python
import numpy as np

# Vector operations
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Dot product
dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)

# Matrix operations
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Matrix multiplication
C = np.matmul(A, B)

# Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)
```
