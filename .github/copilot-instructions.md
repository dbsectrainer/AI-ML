# Copilot Instructions for AI-ML Repository

## Project Overview
This repository is a curated, modular collection of learning resources, guides, and project templates for AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Data Engineering, MLOps, and related fields. It is organized as a knowledge base, not as a monolithic codebase or application.

## Structure & Navigation
- **Top-level directories** represent major domains (e.g., `machine-learning/`, `deep-learning/`, `nlp/`, `data-engineering/`, `mlops/`, `mathematics/`, `programming/`, `ethical-ai/`, `frameworks/`, `projects/`, `business/`).
- **Each subdirectory** contains a `README.md` with curated links, learning paths, and best practices for that topic.
- **No build system or code execution**: This repo is documentation- and resource-focused. There are no scripts, tests, or CI/CD pipelines to run.

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- **All content is markdown-based**. Each topic or subtopic has its own `README.md`.
- **Links are relative** within the repo for easy navigation and portability.
- **Learning paths and project ideas** are provided as lists and diagrams (see main `README.md`).
- **No code or data files** are present—focus is on guides, not implementation.
- **Updates**: Additions/edits should preserve the modular structure and keep navigation clear.

## Contribution Workflow
- Add or update resources by editing the relevant `README.md` in the correct subdirectory.
- Follow the structure and style of existing files—use lists, clear headings, and concise descriptions.
- For new topics, create a new subdirectory with its own `README.md`.
- No need to run tests or builds—validate by checking markdown rendering and link correctness.

## Examples
- To add a new deep learning resource, edit `deep-learning/README.md` or a relevant subtopic.
- To propose a new project idea, update the `README.md` in `projects/` or the main `README.md`.
- To add a new domain (e.g., "Graph ML"), create a new folder and `README.md` following the existing pattern.

## Integration Points
- External resources are referenced via links; no direct integration with APIs or code.
- No cross-component code dependencies—each section is self-contained.

## Special Notes
- **Do not add executable code, scripts, or datasets** to this repository.
- **Keep all content accessible and beginner-friendly**—avoid jargon and explain acronyms.
- **Preserve the modular, topic-based structure** when making changes.
